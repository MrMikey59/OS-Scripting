# GitHub Version Control System (VCS)

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is one of the most popular platforms for
open-source software development. Many programming tools are available:

- [Hammerspoon](https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon)
- [vim](https://github.com/vim/vim) 

- GitHub can display several common image formats, including PNG, JPG, GIF, PSD, and SVG.
- GitHub supports rendering tabular data in the form of CSV (comma-separated) values and TSV (tab-separated values) files.
- GitHub supports rendering of PDF documents.
- GitHub supports rendering of prose documents in the form of Markdown, AsciiDoc, Textile, ReStructuredText,  Rdoc, Org, Creole, MediaWiki, or Pod.
- GitHub has started naming the default branch main instead of master to migrate away from biased terminology (more details available here).  
- GitHub allows you to link multiple email addresses to your account. 

There are two primary ways in which people contribute to projects on GitHub:

- Creating an [issue](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue).
This can be used to report bugs or request a new feature. Neither of these
involves reading or writing code, so it can be pretty lightweight to do.
High-quality bug reports can be extremely valuable to developers. Commenting on
existing discussions can be helpful too.
- Contribute code through a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).
This is generally more involved than creating an issue. You can
[fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
a repository on GitHub, clone your fork, create a new branch, make some changes
(e.g. fix a bug or implement a feature), push the branch, and then [create a
pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
After this, there will generally be some back-and-forth with the project
maintainers, who will give you feedback on your patch. Finally, if all goes
well, your patch will be merged into the upstream repository. Often times,
larger projects will have a contributing guide, tag beginner-friendly issues,
and some even have mentorship programs to help first-time contributors become
familiar with the project.

## Folders Idnetified  
Regarding programs that you execute in your terminal, they are all found in the directories listed in your PATH environment variable and you can use the which command (or the type command) to check where your shell is finding a specific program. In general, there are some conventions about where specific types of files live. Here are some of the ones we talked about, check the Filesystem, Hierarchy Standard for a more comprehensive list.    
    `/bin` - Essential command binaries  
    `/sbin` - Essential system binaries, usually to be run by root  
    `/dev` - Device files, special files that often are interfaces to hardware devices  
    `/etc` - Host-specific system-wide configuration files  
    `/home` - Home directories for users in the system  
    `/lib` - Common libraries for system programs  
    `/opt` - Optional application software  
    `/sys` - Contains information and configuration for the system (covered in the first lecture)  
    `/tmp` - Temporary files (also /var/tmp). Usually deleted between reboots.  
    `/usr/` - Read only user data  
    `/usr/bin` - Non-essential command binaries  
    `/usr/sbin` - Non-essential system binaries, usually to be run by root  
    `/usr/local/bin` - Binaries for user compiled programs  
    `/var` - Variable files like logs or caches
