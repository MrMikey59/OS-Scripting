- GitHub supports rendering of PDF documents.
- GitHub supports rendering of prose documents in the form of Markdown, AsciiDoc, Textile, ReStructuredText,  Rdoc, Org, Creole, MediaWiki, or Pod.

- GitHub allows you to link multiple email addresses to your account. 

## Folders Idnetified  
Regarding programs that you execute in your terminal, they are all found in the directories listed in your PATH environment variable and you can use the which command (or the type command) to check where your shell is finding a specific program. In general, there are some conventions about where specific types of files live. Here are some of the ones we talked about, check the Filesystem, Hierarchy Standard for a more comprehensive list.    
    `/bin` - Essential command binaries  
    `/sbin` - Essential system binaries, usually to be run by root  
    `/dev` - Device files, special files that often are interfaces to hardware devices  
    `/etc` - Host-specific system-wide configuration files  
    `/home` - Home directories for users in the system  
    `/lib` - Common libraries for system programs  
    `/opt` - Optional application software  
    `/sys` - Contains information and configuration for the system (covered in the first lecture)  
    `/tmp` - Temporary files (also /var/tmp). Usually deleted between reboots.  
    `/usr/` - Read only user data  
    `/usr/bin` - Non-essential command binaries  
    `/usr/sbin` - Non-essential system binaries, usually to be run by root  
    `/usr/local/bin` - Binaries for user compiled programs  
    `/var` - Variable files like logs or caches
