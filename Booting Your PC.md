# Booting Your PC

## Booting + Live USBs

When your machine boots up, before the operating system is loaded, the [BIOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS)/[UEFI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface) initializes the system. During this process, you can press a specific key combination to configure this layer of software. For example, your computer may say something like "Press F9 to configure BIOS. Press F12 to enter boot menu." during the boot process. You can configure all sorts of hardware-related settings in the BIOS menu. You can also enter the boot menu to boot from an alternate device instead of your hard drive.

[Live USBs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_USB) are USB flash drives containing an operating system. You can create one of these by downloading an operating system (e.g. a Linux distribution) and burning it to the flash drive. This process is a little bit more complicated than simply copying a `.iso` file to the disk. There are tools like [UNetbootin](https://unetbootin.github.io/) to help you create live USBs.

Live USBs are useful for all sorts of purposes. Among other things, if you break your existing operating system installation so that it no longer boots, you can use a live USB to recover data or fix the operating system.
