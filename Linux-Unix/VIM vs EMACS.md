# VIM vs EMACS

Most use vim as our primary editor but Emacs is also a good alternative and it's worth trying both to see which works better for you. Emacs does not follow vim's modal editing, but this can be enabled through Emacs plugins like [Evil](https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil) or [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs). 
An advantage of using Emacs is that extensions can be implemented in Lisp, a better scripting language than vimscript, Vim's default scripting language.
