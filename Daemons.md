# Daemons

You are probably already familiar with the notion of daemons, even if the word seems new.
Most computers have a series of processes that are always running in the background rather than waiting for a user to launch them and interact with them.
These processes are called daemons and the programs that run as daemons often end with a `d` to indicate so.
For example `sshd`, the SSH daemon, is the program responsible for listening to incoming SSH requests and checking that the remote user has the necessary credentials to log in.

In Linux, `systemd` (the system daemon) is the most common solution for running and setting up daemon processes.
You can run `systemctl status` to list the current running daemons. Most of them might sound unfamiliar but are responsible for core parts of the system such as managing the network, solving DNS queries or displaying the graphical interface for the system.
Systemd can be interacted with the `systemctl` command in order to `enable`, `disable`, `start`, `stop`, `restart` or check the `status` of services (those are the `systemctl` commands).

More interestingly, `systemd` has a fairly accessible interface for configuring and enabling new daemons (or services).
Below is an example of a daemon for running a simple Python app.
We won't go in the details but as you can see most of the fields are pretty self explanatory.

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/myapp.service
[Unit]
Description=My Custom App
After=network.target

[Service]
User=foo
Group=foo
WorkingDirectory=/home/foo/projects/mydaemon
ExecStart=/usr/bin/local/python3.7 app.py
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Also, if you just want to run some program with a given frequency there is no need to build a custom daemon, you can use [`cron`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/cron.8.html), a daemon your system already runs to perform scheduled tasks.
